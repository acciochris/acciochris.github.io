# Reed-Solomon Error Correction --- Decoding

Reed-Solomon codes are an especially powerful tool for efficient multi-bit error detection and
correction. In my last [post](./reed-solomon.md), I discussed how to encode messages. In this post,
I will discuss how to correct errors and decode the message.
