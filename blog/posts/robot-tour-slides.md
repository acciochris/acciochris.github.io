# Robot Tour Recap

Now that the 2024 [Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/) season has concluded, I think it is a
good time to talk a little bit more about [Robot Tour](./robot-tour-line.md) (I didn't mention it
when I posted this, but, yes, it is a scioly event).

A few months ago, I did a presentation on Robot Tour. So, instead of repeating what I said, here is
the [link](https://acciochris.github.io/slides/robot-tour.html) to the presentation.
